# HBK React Test

### Build and run
Use node version 16.17.0

$ npm install

$ npm run dev

The application should run here - http://localhost:5173/

### Notes

The API key is hard coded for convenience sake. Normally it would be in an env file ignored by git.

No unit tests have been written.

**Vite** was used for the project setup.

**react-query** is used for API calls.
